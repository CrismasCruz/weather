<p class="about"> Helvetica or Neue Haas Grotesk is a widely used sans-serif typeface developed
   in 1957 by Swiss typeface designer Max Miedinger with input from Eduard Hoffmann.
   Its a neo-grotesque or realist design, one influenced by the famous 19th century
   typeface Akzidenz-Grotesk and other German and Swiss designs. Its use became
   a hallmark of the International Typographic Style that emerged from the work
   of Swiss designers in the 1950s and 60s, becoming one of the most popular
   typefaces of the 20th century. </p>
